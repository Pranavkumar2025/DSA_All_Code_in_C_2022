I believe in the importance of earning a college degree.  The course award will only push me further towards my Accounting degree and my dreams of one day having a successful career as an ML . Being the first generation in my family to attend college, I have always aspired to learn the right way to manage money and to produce successful budgets. I also believe in giving back to my community by helping others in financial crisis, so they wonâ€™t have the same financial burdens that I had growing up in a single family household. Five years from now I see myself employed at a large local firm, crunching numbers, evaluating, and solving certain financial matters.
